    "# Indian Pines Dataset for hyperspectral classifcation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset is gathered by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral sensor data. Indian Pines dataset was recorded over Northwestern Indiana, USA, and consists of **145x145 pixels** and **224 spectral bands/channels** in the wavelength range **0.4â€“2.5 10^(-6) meters**. This AVIRIS image file represents a 2 mile by 2 mile area at 20 meters spatial resolution. Indian Pines data are available through Pursue's univeristy MultiSpec site. A Matlab version is also available in here where the most noisy bands ([104-108], [150-163], 220) were removed, leaving a total of 200 bands to work with. The Indian Pines scene contains two-thirds agriculture, and one-third forest or other natural perennial vegetation. There are two major dual lane highways, a rail line, as well as some low density housing, other built structures, and smaller roads. The ground truth available is designated into **sixteen classes** (seventeen if you consider the background) and is not all mutually exclusive.\n"
