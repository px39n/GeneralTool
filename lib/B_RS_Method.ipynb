    "\n",
    "The Extended Morphological Profiles (EMP) is based on the mathematical morphology operators known as opening and closing. Briefly, opening and closing transformations can isolate bright (opening) and dark (closing) structures in images. Opening removes small objects from the foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels) of an image, placing them in the background, while closing removes small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background into foreground. Reconstruction method is able to restore the objects completely after applying the underlying operations (erosion/dilation) from the opening/closing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Morphological Profile (MP) enlarges or reduces dark and bright structures using openings and closings by reconstruction, resulting in a more homogeneous version of the original image. At each iteration, the Structuring Element (SE) is increased to capture further spatial information.\n",
